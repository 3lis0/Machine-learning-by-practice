# Obesity risk prediction using multi-class classification

### 1. Objective
The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model to predict the **obesity risk** in individuals based on various attributes.  
Obesity is a critical factor associated with cardiovascular diseases, making early prediction essential for **preventive healthcare**.

---

### 2. Attributes
The dataset includes multiple attributes categorized into the following groups:

#### a) Personal Attributes
- **Gender**: Biological sex of the individual.  
- **Height**: Height of the person (in meters).  
- **Age**: Age of the individual.  
- **Weight**: Current body weight (in kg).  
- **Family history with overweight**: Genetic predisposition to overweight.  
- **Smoking habit (SMOKE)**: Whether the person smokes or not.  

#### b) Eating Habits
- **Frequent consumption of high caloric food (FAVC)**: Regular intake of high-calorie foods.  
- **Frequency of consumption of vegetables (FCVC)**: How often the individual eats vegetables.  
- **Number of main meals (NCP)**: Daily count of main meals.  
- **Consumption of food between meals (CAEC)**: Snacking habits.  
- **Consumption of water daily (CH2O)**: Daily water intake.  
- **Consumption of alcohol (CALC)**: Frequency of alcohol consumption.  

#### c) Physical Condition
- **Calorie consumption monitoring (SCC)**: Monitoring calorie intake.  
- **Physical activity frequency (FAF)**: Regularity of physical activity.  
- **Time using technology devices (TUE)**: Daily screen time.  
- **Transportation used (MTRANS)**: Mode of transportation (e.g., walking, cycling, car).  

#### d) Target Variable
- **NObeyesdad**: Obesity classification of the individual.

##### BMI Categories
| Category             | BMI Range         |
|----------------------|------------------|
| Insufficient Weight  | Less than 18.5   |
| Normal               | 18.5 to 24.9     |
| Overweight           | 25.0 to 29.9     |
| Obesity I            | 30.0 to 34.9     |
| Obesity II           | 35.0 to 39.9     |
| Obesity III          | Higher than 40   |

### 3. Business Impact
Accurately predicting obesity risk can:
- Support **healthcare providers** with early diagnosis.
- Guide **policymakers** in public health strategies.
- Empower **individuals** to make proactive lifestyle changes.  
Ultimately, this leads to reduced healthcare costs and improved public health outcomes.
