#  Machine Learning Tasks Collection

This repository contains a collection of machine learning tasks and mini-projects I've completed while exploring different models, datasets, and problem types. Each task focuses on a specific machine learning concept and includes code, explanations, and results.

The goal is to document my practical ML learning journey and build a foundation for more complex end-to-end projects.
